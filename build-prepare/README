This project
1. Downloads Tomcat and extracts it to a directory specified in the property file.
2. Updates these files:
a. server.xml for Tomcat changing Http port to 8980
b. tomcat-users.xml for Tomcat adding user and passwd
c. settings.xml for Maven ~/m2 updating the server information.
If you want to change any of these values then feel free. If you have custom information in settings.xmk BEWARE!!! before running script.

It works today....
